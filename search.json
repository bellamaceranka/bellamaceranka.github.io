Kindler. Their performances, a masterclass in precision and flair, have been driven by standout gymnasts like Anastasia Webb and Audrey Davis, elevating the sport with their skill and passion.\nBut Oklahoma’s reign hasn’t gone unchallenged. The rise of LSU and California as strong contenders has added an extra layer of interest to the competition.
